# Minnesota Walkability Analysis

## Description
For this project, we are analyizing walkability in the state of Minnesota and it's relationship to other lifestyle factors. We have primarily focused on the EPA's "walkability index" when doing our analysis.  The walkability index is summarized by US "block groups" and is calcuated using inputs such as intersection density, housing and employment mix, and promixity to transit stops.  In many of our charts, we have used weight averages based on population to summarize the data by county in Minnesota.  

We have utilized another dataset, the county health rankings, to explore the relationship between walkability and various health metrics.  The county health rankings is prepared by the U of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and examines the overall health every county in the United States using various data sources.
